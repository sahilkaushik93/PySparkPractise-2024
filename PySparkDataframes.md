## PySpark Dataframes:-
1. PySpark DataFrame is mostly similar to Pandas DataFrame, with the exception that DataFrames are distributed in the cluster (meaning the data in data frames are stored in different machines in a cluster), and any operations in PySpark execute in parallel on all machines, whereas Panda Dataframe stores and operates on a single machine.
